I love open source because the capability for multiple developers to combine their experience and wisdom in an amazingly capable
environment is very important for the industry of technology. To bring together so many brilliant minds is truly a beautiful
thing and there are few things more gratifying than successfully completing a project with others. I haven't really done anything on
GitHub yet but I am very excited to get into the mix of things :).
